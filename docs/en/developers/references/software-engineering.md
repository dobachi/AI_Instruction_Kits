# Software Engineering Reference

## Overview

Software Engineering applies systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approaches to software development, operation, and maintenance. This reference aligns with SWEBOK v4.0 (released October 2024) and emphasizes evidence-based practices.

## SWEBOK v4.0 Major Changes

### New Knowledge Areas
- Software Architecture
- Software Security
- Software Engineering Operations

This expands the knowledge areas from 15 to 18.

### Modernized Content
- Formal integration of Agile and DevOps
- Support for cloud-native and distributed systems
- Updated terminology and improved alignment with related fields

## Modern Development Methodologies (2024-2025)

### Hybrid Agile-DevOps Model
- **Adoption Rate**: 42% of companies
- **Key Integration Points**:
  - Automated CI/CD pipelines within Agile sprints
  - DevOps observability feeding into Agile retrospectives
  - Continuous testing as prerequisite for sprint completion
- **Implementation Impact**: 9x improvement in development frequency

### DevSecOps Integration
- 37% of developers include automated security scanning in DevOps workflows
- Shift-left security practices
- Continuous security testing and compliance checks

## Quality Assurance and Metrics

### 2024-2025 Key Quality Metrics
1. **Test Automation Rate**: Ratio of automated vs manual tests
2. **Build Stability**: Analysis of overall build failure rates
3. **Test Execution Rate**: Automated test case execution over time
4. **Deployment Frequency**: CI/CD pipeline effectiveness measurement
5. **Lead Time**: Code commit to production deployment

### IEEE Quality Standards Framework
- IEEE 1061: Software Quality Metrics Methodology
- Distinction between basic and computed metrics

## Architecture Patterns

### Cloud-Native Microservices
- Service autonomy with minimal dependencies
- Per-service data ownership
- High cohesion with loose coupling
- Circuit breaker, sidecar, and API gateway patterns

### Event-Driven Architecture
- Asynchronous and decoupled processing for complex workflows
- Application to real-time processing and IoT applications
- Integration with microservices and edge computing

### Containers and Orchestration
- 75% of organizations use Infrastructure as Code
- 70% of teams implement observability platforms

## Security and Sustainability

### OWASP 2024-2025
- OWASP Top 10:2025 (new version planned for late summer/autumn 2025)
- ASVS v5.0 (Release Candidate March 31, 2025)
- Security automation through DevSecOps integration

### Sustainable Software Development
- ICT industry contributes 3.9% of global GHG emissions
- Green coding practices:
  - Energy-efficient algorithms
  - Optimized cloud resource usage
  - Carbon footprint tracking tools
- Compliance with EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (2024)

## AI/ML Integration

### MLOps Market Growth
- Projected from $2.19B (2024) to $16.6B (2030)
- 30%+ CAGR growth rate

### Core MLOps Practices
1. Continuous Integration (CI)
2. Continuous Delivery (CD)
3. Continuous Training (CT)
4. Continuous Monitoring (CM)

## Implementation Framework

### Quality Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Code review with security scanning
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Monitoring and observability
- [ ] Documentation as Code practices
- [ ] Performance monitoring and optimization

### Success Metrics Framework
- **Technical Metrics**: Deployment frequency, lead time, failure rate, recovery time
- **Quality Metrics**: Test coverage, bug escape rate, security vulnerabilities
- **Business Metrics**: Time to market, customer satisfaction, operational costs
- **Sustainability Metrics**: Energy consumption, carbon footprint, resource utilization

## Japan-Specific Considerations

1. **Adaptation to Corporate Culture**: Consideration for hierarchical structures and decision-making processes in Japanese companies
2. **Quality-First Culture**: Integration of existing quality management culture with SWEBOK practices
3. **Long-term Employment Practices**: Organizational support for continuous learning and skill development
4. **Regulatory Environment**: Harmonization of Japan-specific requirements with international standards
5. **Kaizen Culture**: Integration with Agile practices
