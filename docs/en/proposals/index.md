# Proposals

This section contains proposal documents for new features and improvements to the AI Instruction Kits.

## ðŸ“‹ Proposal List

### [Academic Modules Implementation Plan](academic_modules_implementation_plan.html)
Implementation plan for five new modules to support academic paper writing: academic_writing, citation_management, literature_review, research_methodology, and thesis_writing. These modules provide comprehensive support for researchers and students to write high-quality academic papers using AI.

### [AI-Driven Modular System](ai_driven_modular_system.html)
Proposal for an AI-powered automatic module generation and optimization system. Using machine learning to analyze user usage patterns, it automatically suggests and generates optimal module configurations.

### [Distributed Metadata System](distributed_metadata_system.html)
Proposal for a system that manages metadata for each instruction module in a distributed manner, enabling efficient search, filtering, and dependency management. YAML-based lightweight metadata management enables operation of large-scale module libraries.

### [Modular Advanced Features](modular_advanced_features.html)
Proposal for advanced extension features of the modular system. Includes enterprise-level features such as dynamic module synthesis, conditional module loading, inter-module communication, and version control.
