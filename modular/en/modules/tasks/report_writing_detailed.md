## Report Writing Best Practices

### 1. Executive Summary Creation

#### Purpose and Audience Understanding
- An executive summary provides an overview of the main points of a larger report
- The reader is usually someone who makes funding, personnel, or policy decisions and needs information quickly and efficiently
- Often written to share with individuals who may not have time to review the entire report

#### Structure and Length
- Make the length of the summary proportional to the full report it summarizes, typically 10-15%
- Most executive summaries are one to two pages
- Avoid jargon, using graphs, charts, and diagrams to illustrate data visually

#### Writing Strategy
- Organize the executive summary according to the sequence of information presented in the full report
- Do not introduce new information that is not in the report
- Write the executive summary last, after completing the report and deciding on recommendations
- Write at the lowest level of technicality, translating specialized terms and complex data into plain language

### 2. Report Type-Specific Approaches

#### Informational Reports
- Present data and facts without analysis or recommendations
- Monthly financial reports, employee productivity reports, progress updates
- Purpose is to keep stakeholders informed about business activities

#### Analytical Reports
- Evaluate information or data to solve problems, answer questions, or make decisions
- Performance evaluations, feasibility studies, market analysis reports
- Compare multiple options and provide recommendations

#### Financial Reports

#### Progress Reports

- Inform stakeholders about status, developments, and whether projects meet planned schedules and goals
- Measure progress (or lack thereof)

#### Feasibility Studies
- Assessment of the practicality of a project or system
- Five main types: technical, financial, market, operational, and legal feasibility
- Objectively uncover strengths and weaknesses of existing business or proposed ventures

### 3. Data Visualization Best Practices
