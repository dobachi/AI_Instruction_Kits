# User Research Module
## Purpose
## Research Methodologies
#### Qualitative Methods
#### Quantitative Methods
#### Mixed Methods Approach
#### Interview Structure
1. **Opening**
2. **Background**
3. **Main Questions**
4. **Deep Dives**
5. **Closing**
#### Best Practices
- Practice active listening without interrupting
- Ask for specific examples and stories
- Avoid leading questions that bias responses
#### Sample Size Guidelines
#### Question Design
- Avoid double-barreled questions
#### Survey Structure
1. Introduction with purpose and time estimate
2. Screening questions (if needed)
3. Easy warm-up questions
4. Core research questions
5. Demographic questions (at end)
#### Response Scales
- Label all scale points clearly
- Include "Not applicable" options where relevant
#### Test Planning
1. Define success metrics and criteria
2. Create realistic task scenarios
3. Prepare testing environment and tools
4. Recruit representative participants
5. Develop moderator guide
#### Testing Approaches
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing design variations
#### Data Collection
- Task completion rates and times
- Error frequency and types
- User satisfaction ratings
- Think-aloud observations
- Post-task questionnaires
#### Key Principles
- Observe users in their natural environment
- Focus on actual behavior vs. reported behavior
- Look for workarounds and adaptations
- Document context and environmental factors
- Build empathy through immersion
#### Methods
- **Shadowing**: Follow users through their day
#### Duration and Scope
- Medium-term: Multi-day shadowing studies
## Analysis Frameworks
#### Process
1. Capture all observations on individual notes
2. Group similar items based on themes
3. Label groups with descriptive headers
4. Identify patterns and relationships
5. Extract insights and opportunities
#### Applications
- Synthesizing interview data
- Identifying user needs and pain points
- Creating persona attributes
- Developing feature priorities
- Building empathy maps
#### Core Components
- **Phases**: Key stages in the user experience
- **Actions**: What users do at each stage
- **Thoughts**: User mindset and considerations
- **Emotions**: Feelings throughout the journey
- **Opportunities**: Areas for improvement
#### Mapping Process
1. Define scope and persona
2. Gather data through research
3. Map the current state journey
4. Identify pain points and moments of delight
5. Envision future state improvements
#### Effective Personas Include
- Demographics (age, occupation, location)
- Goals and motivations
- Behaviors and habits
- Pain points and frustrations
- Technology proficiency
- Quotes from real users
#### Creation Process
1. Analyze research data for patterns
2. Identify distinct user segments
3. Create composite profiles based on data
4. Validate with additional research
5. Socialize across the organization
#### Core Concept
- What progress are users trying to make?
- What are the circumstances of their struggle?
#### JTBD Interview Technique
1. Start with a specific instance of behavior
2. Work backwards to understand the trigger
3. Explore alternative solutions considered
4. Understand the criteria for success
5. Document the complete job story
## Research Ethics and Bias Mitigation
#### Modern Consent Approach
- Use plain language (9th-grade reading level)
- Provide multiple opt-in points
- Make withdrawal easy at any time
- Store consent documentation securely
- Adapt for accessibility needs
#### Essential Elements
- Study purpose and duration
- What participation involves
- How data will be used and stored
- Participant rights and protections
- Contact information for questions
- Compensation details (if applicable)
#### Recruitment
- Diversify recruitment channels
- Compensate fairly for participation
- Remove unnecessary screening criteria
- Accommodate different schedules
- Provide multiple participation options
#### Accessibility
- Offer multiple communication modes
- Ensure physical accessibility
- Provide materials in multiple formats
- Allow for assistive technologies
- Be flexible with session structure
#### Cultural Sensitivity
- Research cultural contexts beforehand
- Use culturally appropriate methods
- Avoid assumptions about "normal"
- Work with cultural liaisons when needed
- Adapt protocols for different contexts
#### Researcher Bias
- Acknowledge personal assumptions
- Use structured protocols
- Have multiple researchers analyze data
- Seek contradictory evidence
- Document decision rationale
#### Participant Bias
- Create comfortable environments
- Use neutral language in questions
- Triangulate with multiple methods
- Observe behavior vs. just asking
- Account for social desirability bias
#### Analysis Bias
- Code data systematically
- Look for negative cases
- Have others review findings
- Use quantitative validation
- Document analysis process
