# User Research Module

## Purpose
This module provides structured guidance for conducting comprehensive user research. It covers methodologies, analysis frameworks, and ethical practices to ensure inclusive and effective research outcomes.

## Research Methodologies

### 1. Research Approach Selection

#### Qualitative Methods
Best for understanding "why" and exploring user motivations:
- **User Interviews**: Semi-structured conversations to understand user needs and experiences
- **Ethnographic Studies**: Observing users in their natural environment over extended periods
- **Contextual Inquiry**: Observing and interviewing users while they work
- **Diary Studies**: Long-term self-reporting of user experiences
- **Focus Groups**: Group discussions for diverse perspectives

#### Quantitative Methods
Best for measuring "what," "how many," and validating hypotheses:
- **Surveys**: Structured questionnaires for statistical analysis
- **Analytics**: Behavioral data from digital products
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing variations to measure performance
- **Usability Metrics**: Task completion rates, time on task, error rates
- **Card Sorting**: Information architecture validation

#### Mixed Methods Approach
Combine qualitative depth with quantitative validation:
- Start with qualitative research to explore and understand
- Use quantitative methods to validate findings at scale
- Iterate between both approaches throughout the project

### 2. Interview Techniques and Protocols

#### Interview Structure
1. **Opening**: Build rapport and set expectations
2. **Background**: Understand participant context
3. **Main Questions**: Explore key research topics
4. **Deep Dives**: Follow interesting threads
5. **Closing**: Summarize and check for final thoughts

#### Best Practices
- Use open-ended questions ("Tell me about..." rather than "Do you...")
- Practice active listening without interrupting
- Ask for specific examples and stories
- Avoid leading questions that bias responses
- Use the retrospective think-aloud protocol for task observation

#### Sample Size Guidelines
- Qualitative interviews: 5-8 participants per user segment
- Usability testing: 5 participants identify 85% of issues
- Quantitative studies: 20-40+ for statistical significance

### 3. Survey Design Principles

#### Question Design
- Start with clear objectives tied to research goals
- Use simple, unambiguous language (9th-grade reading level)
- Mix closed-ended questions for quantitative data
- Include open-ended questions for qualitative insights
- Avoid double-barreled questions

#### Survey Structure
1. Introduction with purpose and time estimate
2. Screening questions (if needed)
3. Easy warm-up questions
4. Core research questions
5. Demographic questions (at end)

#### Response Scales
- Use consistent scales throughout (e.g., 5-point Likert)
- Label all scale points clearly
- Consider cultural differences in scale interpretation
- Include "Not applicable" options where relevant

### 4. Usability Testing Frameworks

#### Test Planning
1. Define success metrics and criteria
2. Create realistic task scenarios
3. Prepare testing environment and tools
4. Recruit representative participants
5. Develop moderator guide

#### Testing Approaches
- **Moderated Testing**: Direct observation and interaction
- **Unmoderated Testing**: Remote, self-guided sessions
- **Guerrilla Testing**: Quick, informal public testing
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing design variations
- **First-Click Testing**: Evaluating initial interactions

#### Data Collection
- Task completion rates and times
- Error frequency and types
- User satisfaction ratings
- Think-aloud observations
- Post-task questionnaires

### 5. Ethnographic Research Approaches

#### Key Principles
- Observe users in their natural environment
- Focus on actual behavior vs. reported behavior
- Look for workarounds and adaptations
- Document context and environmental factors
- Build empathy through immersion

#### Methods
- **Direct Observation**: Watch without interfering
- **Participant Observation**: Engage while observing
- **Shadowing**: Follow users through their day
- **Cultural Probes**: Give users tools to self-document
- **Photo/Video Documentation**: Visual evidence of behaviors

#### Duration and Scope
- Short-term: 2-4 hour contextual inquiry sessions
- Medium-term: Multi-day shadowing studies
- Long-term: Weeks or months of periodic observation

## Analysis Frameworks

### 1. Affinity Mapping

#### Process
1. Capture all observations on individual notes
2. Group similar items based on themes
3. Label groups with descriptive headers
4. Identify patterns and relationships
5. Extract insights and opportunities

#### Applications
- Synthesizing interview data
- Identifying user needs and pain points
- Creating persona attributes
- Developing feature priorities
- Building empathy maps

### 2. Journey Mapping

#### Core Components
- **Phases**: Key stages in the user experience
- **Actions**: What users do at each stage
- **Thoughts**: User mindset and considerations
- **Emotions**: Feelings throughout the journey
- **Touchpoints**: Interactions with product/service
- **Opportunities**: Areas for improvement

#### Mapping Process
1. Define scope and persona
2. Gather data through research
3. Map the current state journey
4. Identify pain points and moments of delight
5. Envision future state improvements

### 3. Persona Development

#### Effective Personas Include
- Demographics (age, occupation, location)
- Goals and motivations
- Behaviors and habits
- Pain points and frustrations
- Technology proficiency
- Quotes from real users

#### Creation Process
1. Analyze research data for patterns
2. Identify distinct user segments
3. Create composite profiles based on data
4. Validate with additional research
5. Socialize across the organization

### 4. Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

#### Core Concept
Focus on the job users are trying to accomplish, not just their demographics:
- What progress are users trying to make?
- What are the circumstances of their struggle?
- What are the functional, emotional, and social dimensions?

#### JTBD Interview Technique
1. Start with a specific instance of behavior
2. Work backwards to understand the trigger
3. Explore alternative solutions considered
4. Understand the criteria for success
5. Document the complete job story

## Research Ethics and Bias Mitigation

### 1. Informed Consent Best Practices

#### Modern Consent Approach
- Use plain language (9th-grade reading level)
- Provide multiple opt-in points
- Make withdrawal easy at any time
- Store consent documentation securely
- Adapt for accessibility needs

#### Essential Elements
- Study purpose and duration
- What participation involves
- How data will be used and stored
- Participant rights and protections
- Contact information for questions
- Compensation details (if applicable)

### 2. Inclusive Research Methods

#### Recruitment
- Diversify recruitment channels
- Compensate fairly for participation
- Remove unnecessary screening criteria
- Accommodate different schedules
- Provide multiple participation options

#### Accessibility
- Offer multiple communication modes
- Ensure physical accessibility

- Allow for assistive technologies
- Be flexible with session structure

#### Cultural Sensitivity
- Research cultural contexts beforehand
- Use culturally appropriate methods
- Avoid assumptions about "normal"
- Work with cultural liaisons when needed
- Adapt protocols for different contexts

### 3. Bias Mitigation Strategies

#### Researcher Bias
- Acknowledge personal assumptions
- Use structured protocols
- Have multiple researchers analyze data
- Seek contradictory evidence
- Document decision rationale

#### Participant Bias
- Create comfortable environments
- Use neutral language in questions
- Triangulate with multiple methods
- Observe behavior vs. just asking
- Account for social desirability bias

#### Analysis Bias
- Code data systematically
- Look for negative cases
- Have others review findings
- Use quantitative validation
- Document analysis process
