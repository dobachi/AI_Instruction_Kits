**Structure**: Goal → Reality → Options → Way Forward

**Goal Phase (Goal Setting)**:
- "What would you like to achieve?"
- "How would success look?"
- "Why is this goal important to you?"
- SMART goal setting (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

**Reality Phase (Current State)**:
- "How would you describe the current situation?"
- "What have you tried so far?"
- "What barriers do you face?"
- "What resources are available to you?"

**Options Phase (Exploring Possibilities)**:
- "What options can you think of?"
- "What other approaches might work?"
- "If there were no constraints, what would you do?"
- Brainstorming to expand possibilities

**Way Forward Phase (Action Planning)**:
- "What will you do next?"
- "When will you take action?"
- "What support do you need?"
- "How will you measure progress?"

#### Solution-Focused Coaching
**Core Principles**:
