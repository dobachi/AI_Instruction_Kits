# Scrum Framework Module

## Overview
This module provides a modern Scrum framework implementation based on the Scrum Guide 2020. It adopts a comprehensive approach including accountabilities (evolved from roles), unified Scrum Team, Product Goal emphasis, self-management, and true leadership.

## Scrum Theory and Values

### 1. Empiricism and Lean Thinking

#### Modern Implementation of Three Pillars

  - Immediate sharing of work progress and impediments
  - Continuous information disclosure to stakeholders

- **Inspection**
  - Automated quality checks and continuous monitoring
  - Quantitative evaluation of Sprint Goal achievement
  - Continuous verification of Product Increment

- **Adaptation**
  - Data-driven adjustments and improvements
  - Rapid pivoting and direction changes
  - Shortened learning cycles

### 2. Practicing Scrum Values

#### Embodying the Five Values
```
Commitment:
- Collective commitment to the Product Goal

- Technical approach decisions
- Identifying dependencies and risks

#### Remote-First Practices
```
Pre-preparation (Asynchronous):
- Product Backlog refinement
- Technical investigation and spikes
- Pre-collection of questions

Synchronous Session (2-4 hours):

- Commitment confirmation
```

### 3. Daily Scrum

#### Optimizing 15 Minutes
**Beyond Traditional Three Questions**:

- Immediate coordination for emergencies
```

### 4. Sprint Review

#### Stakeholder Engagement
**Interactive Demonstrations**:
- Hands-on sessions

- Roadmap adjustments
```

### 5. Sprint Retrospective

#### Retrospectives with Psychological Safety
**Data-Driven Retros**:
- Sprint metrics analysis
