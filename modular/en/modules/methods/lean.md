## Lean Development Methodology

### Core Configuration
- **Application**: {{lean_application}}
- **Waste Focus**: {{waste_focus}}
- **Value Stream**: {{value_stream_scope}}
- **Improvement**: {{improvement_approach}}

### 7 Lean Principles (2024)
1. **Eliminate Waste**: 8 wastes (partially done, extra features, relearning, handoffs, task switching, delays, defects, underutilized talent)
2. **Amplify Learning**: Fast feedback, AI-assisted insights
3. **Decide Late**: Last responsible moment, options thinking
4. **Deliver Fast**: Micro-releases, feature toggles
5. **Empower Team**: Decentralized decisions, psychological ownership
6. **Build Integrity**: Architectural consistency, UX unity
7. **Optimize Whole**: End-to-end, systems thinking

### Value Stream Mapping
- **Current State**: Map all steps, identify bottlenecks
- **Future State**: Design ideal flow
- **Key Metrics**: Process efficiency, cycle time, WIP

### Lean Startup Integration
**Build-Measure-Learn**:
- Weekly cycles
- MVP strategies (Concierge, Wizard of Oz, Landing Page)
- Rapid hypothesis testing

### Just-In-Time Development
- Pull-based system with Kanban
- WIP limits
- Cost of Delay prioritization

### Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)
- **Daily**: 5-min standup improvements
- **Events**: 1-5 day focused improvements
- **Types**: Process, technical, quality, team

### Quality Built-In
- Preventive approach with quality gates
- Jidoka (intelligent automation)
- Anomaly detection, auto-stop

### Lean Metrics
- **Flow**: Throughput, cycle time, efficiency
- **Quality**: Defect rates, test coverage, technical debt

### Implementation
- Phase 1: VSM, waste identification (1-3mo)
- Phase 2: Pull system, automation (3-6mo)
- Phase 3: Culture establishment (6-12mo)
