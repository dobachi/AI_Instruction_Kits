   - Countermeasure: MVP approach, value-driven development

3. **Relearning**
   - Knowledge rediscovery, solving same problems again
   - Countermeasure: Knowledge management, documentation automation

4. **Handoffs**
   - Wait time between teams and processes
   - Countermeasure: Cross-functional teams, DevOps

5. **Task Switching**
   - Efficiency loss from multitasking
   - Countermeasure: Kanban, flow optimization

6. **Delays**
   - Decision delays, approval process stagnation
