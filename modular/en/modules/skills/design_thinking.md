## Design Thinking Process

### Process Overview
- **Phase**: {{process_phase}}
- **Iteration Count**: {{iteration_count}}
- **User Involvement Level**: {{user_involvement_level}}

### 1. Empathize

#### User Research
- Interview studies
- Observational research (ethnography)
- Shadowing
- Creating empathy maps

#### Data Collection
- Qualitative data gathering
- User behavior pattern analysis
- Pain point identification
- Latent needs discovery

### 2. Define

#### Problem Structuring
- Organizing and analyzing collected information
- Creating affinity diagrams
- User journey mapping
- Stakeholder mapping

#### POV (Point of View) Statement
- "[User] needs [need] because [insight]"
- Creating HMW (How Might We) questions
- Clarifying problem definition
- Prioritizing challenges to solve

### 3. Ideate

#### Brainstorming
- Defer judgment
- Strive for quantity
- Build on others' ideas
- Encourage wild ideas

#### Creative Techniques
- SCAMPER method
- Mind mapping
- Forced association
- Six thinking hats
- Brainwriting

#### Idea Convergence
- Categorizing and organizing ideas
- Feasibility assessment
- Impact evaluation
- Voting or dot voting

### 4. Prototype

#### Prototyping Methods
- Paper prototypes
- Digital prototypes
- Role-playing
- Storyboards
