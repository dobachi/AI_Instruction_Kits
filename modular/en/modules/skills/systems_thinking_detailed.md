# Systems Thinking Skill Module

## Core Principles of Systems Thinking

### 1. System Boundaries and Components

{{#if system_boundaries}}
{{system_boundaries}}
{{/if}}

- **Clarifying System Boundaries**
  - Define the scope of analysis
  - Distinguish internal and external elements
  - Identify interface points

- **Identifying Components**
  - Major actors/components
  - Their roles and functions
  - Interdependencies

### 2. Feedback Loops

{{#if feedback_loop_analysis}}
**Analysis Depth**: {{feedback_loop_analysis}}
{{/if}}

#### Reinforcing Loops (Positive Feedback)
- Promote growth or expansion
- Potential for exponential change
- Need for control mechanisms

#### Balancing Loops (Negative Feedback)
- System stabilization effect
- Convergence to target values
- Maintaining homeostasis

### 3. Leverage Points (Donella Meadows' 12 Leverage Points)

{{#if leverage_points}}
**Leverage Points Application**: {{leverage_points}}
{{/if}}

Identifying intervention points for maximum system impact (ordered from least to most effective):

**Numbers and Parameters (Low Effectiveness)**
12. Constants, numbers, subsidies, taxes
11. Material stocks and flows (road sizes, factory locations, etc.)
10. Regulating negative feedback loops (constitutions, laws, regulations)
9. Information flows (who has access to information)

**Feedback and Structure (Medium Effectiveness)**
8. Self-organization rules (the power to change rules)
7. Goals (the purpose or function of the system)
6. Paradigms (the shared ideas from which the system arises)

**Highest Level (High Effectiveness)**
5. Transcending paradigms (staying unattached to any particular worldview)

**Modern Applications:**
- **Digital Transformation**: Data governance (information flows) vs algorithmic transparency
- **Sustainability**: Carbon pricing (parameters) vs circular economy paradigm shift
- **Organizational Change**: KPI changes (numbers) vs cultural transformation (paradigms)

### 4. Emergence and Non-linearity

{{#if complexity_level}}
**Complexity Level**: {{complexity_level}}
{{/if}}

- **Emergent Properties**
  - Whole behavior exceeding sum of parts
  - Unpredictable new properties emerging

- **Non-linear Causality**
  - Small changes potentially causing large impacts
  - Considering delay effects
  - Critical points and tipping points

## System Archetypes and Modern Applications

{{#if application_domain}}
**Application Domain**: {{application_domain}}
{{/if}}

### Basic System Archetypes

1. **Limits to Growth**
   - Initial exponential growth
   - Growth slowdown due to constraints
   - **Modern Examples**: Platform economics, environmental capacity, digital divide

2. **Shifting the Burden**
   - Dependence on short-term solutions
   - Unresolved root causes
   - **Modern Examples**: Technical debt, symptomatic policy responses, greenwashing

3. **Success to the Successful**
   - Winner-takes-all dynamics
   - Inequality expansion mechanisms
   - **Modern Examples**: Tech platform monopolies, wealth concentration, digital divide

### Climate Change & Sustainability Archetypes

4. **Rebound Effect**
   - Efficiency improvements lead to increased total consumption
   - Energy efficiency vs energy consumption dynamics

5. **Externality Internalization Delays**
   - Environmental and social costs externalized
   - Delayed regulatory or pricing mechanisms

6. **Decarbonization Competition**
   - Short-term economic interests vs long-term sustainability
   - Local benefits vs global challenges

### Digital Transformation Archetypes

7. **Digital Transformation Pitfalls**
   - Technology adoption masking organizational root issues
   - Digitization vs true digital transformation

8. **Data Siloization**
   - Departmental optimization preventing enterprise optimization
   - Information sharing barriers

{{#if time_horizon}}
## Time Horizon Considerations

{{time_horizon}}

- **Short-term impacts**: Immediately apparent changes
- **Medium-term impacts**: System adaptation and adjustment
- **Long-term impacts**: Structural changes and new equilibria

### Modern Temporal Dynamics
- **Digital acceleration**: Compressed feedback cycles in digital systems
- **Climate urgency**: Long-term consequences requiring immediate action
- **Organizational learning**: Building adaptive capacity for continuous change

## Modern Systems Analysis Methodologies

### 1. Soft Systems Methodology (SSM)

**Seven-Stage Process**:
1. Explore the problem situation
2. Express the problem situation (rich pictures)
3. Root definitions of relevant systems
4. Build conceptual models
5. Compare models with reality
6. Define feasible and desirable changes
7. Take action to improve the problem situation

**Characteristics**: 
- Applied to "soft" problems (ill-defined problems)
- Systems analysis as a learning process
- Emphasizes differences in stakeholder worldviews

### 2. Critical Systems Heuristics (CSH)

**12 Boundary Questions**:
- **Motivation**: Who ought to benefit? What ought to be the purpose? What ought to be the measure of success?
- **Control**: Who ought to be the decision maker? What resources ought to be controlled? Who ought to belong to the professionals?
- **Knowledge**: Who ought to be considered a professional expert? What expertise ought to be consulted? Who ought to guarantee success?
- **Legitimacy**: Who ought to belong to the witnesses? What secures the emancipation? What worldview is determining?

### 3. Integrated Analysis Process

**Phase 1: System Definition and Exploration**
1. **Multi-perspective Problem Definition**
