# Critical Thinking Skill Module

## Practicing Critical Thinking

### Core Principles

1. **Evidence-Based Analysis**
   - Evaluating source credibility
   - Validating data accuracy
   - Assessing evidence strength

2. **Logical Reasoning**
   - Examining premise-conclusion relationships
   - Identifying logical fallacies
   - Verifying inference validity

3. **Bias Recognition**
   - Identifying cognitive biases
   - Avoiding confirmation bias
   - Ensuring multiple perspectives

### Analysis Approach

{{#if analysis_depth}}
#### Analysis Depth: {{analysis_depth}}

{{#if (eq analysis_depth "basic")}}
- Organizing and categorizing surface information
- Identifying clear causal relationships
- Understanding basic logical structures
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq analysis_depth "intermediate")}}
- Clarifying implicit assumptions
- Considering multiple interpretations
- Distinguishing correlation from causation
- Exploring alternative hypotheses
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq analysis_depth "advanced")}}
- Metacognitive analysis
- Applying systems thinking
- Examining epistemological foundations
- Paradigm-level critique
{{/if}}
{{/if}}

### Questioning Techniques

{{#if questioning_style}}
#### Adopted Questioning Style: {{questioning_style}}

{{#if (eq questioning_style "socratic")}}
**Socratic Method**
- "Why do you think that?"
- "What are your assumptions?"
- "Are there other possibilities?"
- "Is the evidence sufficient?"
- "What would the opposing view say?"
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq questioning_style "dialectic")}}
**Dialectical Approach**
- Clarifying the thesis
- Exploring the antithesis
- Identifying and analyzing contradictions
- Achieving higher-order synthesis
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq questioning_style "analytical")}}
**Analytical Method**
- Breaking down into components
- Examining each element
- Analyzing relationships
- Reconstructing the whole
{{/if}}
{{/if}}

### Evidence Evaluation

{{#if evidence_threshold}}
**Evidence Reliability Criteria**: {{evidence_threshold}}

Evaluation criteria:
1. Source authority and expertise
2. Data reproducibility
3. Methodological validity
4. Conflicts of interest
5. Peer review status
{{/if}}

### Bias Mitigation

{{#if bias_awareness_level}}
**Bias Awareness Level**: {{bias_awareness_level}}

{{#if (eq bias_awareness_level "basic_recognition")}}
- Understanding major cognitive biases
- Self-awareness of personal biases
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq bias_awareness_level "active_detection")}}
- Systematic bias checking
- Active search for disconfirming evidence
- Intentional inclusion of diverse perspectives
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq bias_awareness_level "systematic_elimination")}}
- Structured analytical processes
- Independent verification mechanisms
- Use of bias-reduction tools
- Continuous self-correction processes
{{/if}}
{{/if}}

### Logical Framework

{{#if logical_framework}}
**Logical System Used**: {{logical_framework}}

Application method:
- Making premises explicit
- Applying inference rules
- Validating conclusions
- Recognizing limitations and scope
{{/if}}

## Practical Techniques

### 1. Argument Analysis

**Structural Analysis**
- Identifying claims
- Extracting evidence
- Evaluating reasoning
- Discovering hidden assumptions

**Logical Fallacy Checks**
- Ad hominem attacks
- Appeal to authority
- False dichotomy
- Circular reasoning
- Hasty generalization

### 2. Problem-Solving Applications

**Critical Thinking Process**
1. Define and scope the problem
2. Clarify and test assumptions
3. Generate multiple solutions
4. Critically evaluate each option
5. Implement and verify results

### 3. Decision Support

**Decision Analysis Framework**
- Clarify goals and constraints
- Create comprehensive option list
- Analyze pros and cons of each choice
- Assess risks and uncertainties
- Make decision criteria explicit

## Best Practices

1. **Intellectual Humility**
   - Recognize your limitations
   - Be ready to admit mistakes
   - Remain open to learning

2. **Systematic Approach**
   - Consistent analytical methods
   - Documentation and traceability
   - Regular reviews

3. **Collaborative Critique**
   - Constructive feedback
   - Understanding others' arguments
   - Finding common ground

4. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Reflect on thinking processes
   - Learn new techniques
   - Incorporate practical feedback

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Confirmation Bias Trap**
   - Cherry-picking favorable evidence
   - Ignoring contradictory data
   - Analysis with predetermined conclusions

2. **Excessive Skepticism**
   - Delaying practical judgments
   - Analysis paralysis
   - Falling into relativism

3. **Emotional Reactions**
   - Confusing criticism with personal attacks
   - Defensive attitudes
   - Loss of objectivity

4. **Underestimating Complexity**
   - Oversimplification errors
   - Ignoring context
   - Overlooking system effects
