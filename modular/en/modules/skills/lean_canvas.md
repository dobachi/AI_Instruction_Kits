# Lean Canvas

## Overview
The Lean Canvas, developed by Ash Maurya, is a framework that visualizes a startup or new business model on a single canvas. Composed of 9 key elements, it enables rapid hypothesis formation and validation.

## Key Components

### 1. Problem
Identify the top 3 problems customers face:
- **Problem Clarification**: Is it a problem worth solving?
- **Existing Alternatives**: How is it currently being solved?
- **Pain Point Depth**: How urgent is the problem?

### 2. Solution
Top 3 features/solutions for the problems:
- **Minimum Features**: Essential features for MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
- **Differentiation Elements**: How it differs from existing solutions
- **Feasibility**: Technical and resource feasibility

### 3. Key Metrics
Important metrics to measure success:
- **Acquisition**: New customer acquisition, conversion rate
- **Activation**: Active user rate, first-time usage rate
- **Retention**: Retention rate, churn rate
- **Revenue**: LTV (Lifetime Value), ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
- **Referral**: NPS (Net Promoter Score), referral rate

### 4. Unique Value Proposition
Clear and compelling value offered to customers:
- **One-liner**: Who you serve and what you provide
- **Customer Benefits**: Why customers should choose you
- **Differentiation**: What sets you apart from competitors

### 5. Unfair Advantage
Advantages that cannot be easily copied:
- **Network Effects**: Value increase with user growth
- **Proprietary Technology**: Patents, know-how
- **Brand**: Trust, recognition
- **First-mover Advantage**: Market capture

### 6. Customer Segments
Target customer groups:
- **Early Adopters**: First customers to understand the value
- **Market Size**: TAM/SAM/SOM
- **Personas**: Specific customer profiles
- **Customer Characteristics**: Demographics, psychographics

### 7. Channels
Paths to reach customers:
- **Awareness**: How customers discover you
- **Acquisition**: How they become customers
- **Delivery**: How value is delivered
- **After-service**: How support is provided

### 8. Cost Structure
Costs required for business operations:
- **Fixed Costs**: Salaries, office, infrastructure
- **Variable Costs**: Production costs, marketing expenses
- **Initial Investment**: Development costs, equipment
- **Unit Economics**: Per-customer profitability

### 9. Revenue Streams
Methods to generate revenue:
- **Pricing Strategy**: Pricing rationale
- **Revenue Model**: Subscription, pay-per-use, one-time sale
- **Payment Timing**: Prepaid, postpaid
- **Revenue Diversification**: Multiple revenue sources

## Validation Techniques

### Hypothesis Validation Flow
1. **Set Hypotheses**: Create hypotheses for each element
2. **Design Experiments**: Design validation with minimal resources
3. **Collect Data**: Interviews, surveys, behavioral observation
4. **Learn and Iterate**: Analyze results, decide to pivot or persevere

### Customer Development
- **Problem Interviews**: Validate problem assumptions
- **Solution Interviews**: Confirm solution acceptance
- **MVP Testing**: Test market response with actual product
- **Scale Testing**: Validate growth potential

### Pivot Decision Criteria
- **Stagnant Metrics**: Key metrics not improving
- **Customer Feedback**: Misalignment with needs
- **Competitive Changes**: Market environment shifts
- **Resource Depletion**: Sustainability issues

## Stage-based Applications

### Idea Stage
- Fill all elements with hypotheses
- Identify highest-risk assumptions
- Plan quick and cheap validation

### Validation Stage
- Reflect customer interview results
- Update metrics with MVP results
- Pivot as necessary

### Growth Stage
- Verify scalability
- Optimize unit economics
- Consider expansion to new segments

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it to One Page**: Maintain a bird's-eye view
2. **Regular Updates**: Continuously update based on learning
3. **Team Sharing**: Ensure everyone has the same understanding
4. **Quantify**: Express quantitatively whenever possible
5. **Prioritize**: Validate highest-risk assumptions first

## Use Cases

### B2C Startup
- Problem: Difficulty maintaining health habits
- Solution: AI-coaching fitness app
- UVP: "Personal AI trainer that guarantees habit formation in 3 months"

### B2B SaaS
- Problem: Sales activity inefficiency
- Solution: AI sales support tool
- UVP: "Next-gen CRM that doubles sales efficiency"

## Important Considerations

- **Eliminate Assumptions**: Base decisions on objective data
- **Customer Perspective**: Think from customer's viewpoint, not yours
- **Execution Focus**: Execute quickly and learn, don't seek perfection
- **Flexibility**: Don't be stubborn, pivot when necessary
