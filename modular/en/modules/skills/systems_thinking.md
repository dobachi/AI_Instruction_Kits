# Systems Thinking Skill Module

## Core Principles of Systems Thinking

#### Reinforcing Loops (Positive Feedback)
- Promote growth or expansion
- Potential for exponential change
- Need for control mechanisms

#### Balancing Loops (Negative Feedback)
- System stabilization effect
- Convergence to target values
- Maintaining homeostasis

### Traditional Visualization Methods
{{#switch diagram_style}}
{{#case "causal_loop"}}
**Causal Loop Diagrams**
- Express causal relationships with arrows
- Show relationship nature with +/-
- Identify reinforcing/balancing loops
{{/case}}
{{#case "stock_flow"}}
**Stock and Flow Diagrams**
- Distinguish stocks (accumulations) and flows
- Show changes over time explicitly
- Suitable for quantitative analysis
{{/case}}
{{#case "rich_picture"}}
**Rich Pictures**
- Visual representation of overall situation
- Stakeholder relationships
- Include emotions and concerns
{{/case}}
{{/switch}}

### Modern System Mapping Tools
**Digital Twin Technology**
- Real-time virtual representation of physical systems
- Integration with IoT sensor data
- Predictive simulation and optimization
- Applications in manufacturing, urban planning, healthcare
**Network Analysis and Visualization**
- NetworkX (Python), Gephi, Cytoscape
- Social network analysis
- Organizational relationship visualization
- Centrality analysis for influence mapping
**Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)**
- NetLogo, MESA, AnyLogic
- Complex adaptive systems analysis
- Policy simulation and social phenomena analysis
**Interactive Visualization Platforms**
- Kumu.io (specialized for system mapping)
- Vensim (system dynamics)
- InsightMaker (free systems thinking tool)
- Observable, D3.js (custom visualizations)
