# Web Research Skills

## Overview

Skills for efficiently searching, evaluating, and utilizing accurate and reliable information from the vast internet. Practices information literacy for the AI era using proven methods like SIFT, lateral reading, and fact-checking.

## Quick Reference

### SIFT Method - 4-Step Information Evaluation

| Step | Action | Checkpoints |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **Stop** | Pause and think | Suppress emotional reactions, clarify research purpose |
| **Investigate** | Research the source | Author expertise, organization credibility, funding |
| **Find** | Discover better sources | Multiple independent sources, expert opinions |
| **Trace** | Track to original | Citation accuracy, contextual integrity |

### Lateral Reading Practice

```yaml
Basic Steps:
  1. First impression in 30 seconds
  2. Search "[site name] reputation" in new tab
  3. Check Wikipedia, Media Bias/Fact Check
  4. Cross-verify claims with multiple sources
```

### Search Operator Quick Reference

| Operator | Function | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `"phrase"` | Exact match | `"climate change"` |
| `-word` | Exclude | `AI -advertising` |
| `site:` | Site specific | `site:gov` |
| `filetype:` | File format | `filetype:pdf` |
| `2023..2024` | Date range | `"generative AI" 2023..2024` |

## Source Credibility Assessment

### Quick Credibility Check

```yaml
High Credibility:
  - Government agencies (.gov)
  - Peer-reviewed academic papers
  - Established media outlets
  - Official institutional announcements

Caution Required:
  - Personal blogs/social media posts
  - Sales-oriented sites
  - Anonymous sources
  - Sites with extreme claims

Red Flags:
  - No author information
  - No contact details
  - Excessive advertising
  - Emotional language
```

## AI-Generated Content Identification

### Text Characteristics

- ✓ Overly polished sentence structure
- ✓ Lack of specific experiences
- ✓ Generic statements
- ✓ Knowledge cutoff at 2021-2023

### Image/Video Verification

- ✓ Hand/finger abnormalities (number/shape)
- ✓ Distorted text
- ✓ Inconsistent lighting/shadows
- ✓ No matches in reverse image search

## Fact-Checking Process

```yaml
1. Verify Checkability:
   - Are there specific numbers/dates/locations?
   
2. Triangulation:
   - Confirm with at least 3 independent sources
   
3. Original Source Check:
   - Directly verify quoted original text
   
4. Expert Verification:
   - Check expert opinions in the field
```

## Field-Specific Quick Guide
