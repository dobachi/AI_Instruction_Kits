# Software Engineering Expertise Module

## Overview
Software Engineering in 2024-2025 is defined by SWEBOK v4.0 standards, emphasizing sustainability, accessibility, and AI integration throughout the development lifecycle.

## Core Principles

### SWEBOK v4.0 Knowledge Areas
- **Core Areas**: Requirements, design, construction, testing, maintenance
- **New Areas**: Security (DevSecOps), sustainability (green computing), AI/ML integration, accessibility

### Modern Development Paradigms
- **Continuous Everything**: CI/CD/CT/CM (Monitoring)
- **Shift-Left**: Security, testing, and operations from the start
- **AI-Augmented Development**: Copilot systems and automated reviews
- **Sustainability-First**: Carbon footprint in all decisions

## Implementation Guide

### Modern Architecture Framework
```python
class ModernSoftwareArchitecture:
    def __init__(self, config: Dict):
        self.quality_gates = self._setup_quality_gates()
        self.sustainability_tracker = SustainabilityTracker()
        
    async def design_system(self, requirements: List[Dict]) -> Dict:
        # AI-augmented requirements analysis
        analyzed_reqs = await self._ai_requirements_analysis(requirements)
        
        # Pattern selection based on requirements
        patterns = self._select_architecture_patterns(analyzed_reqs)
        
        # Component design with sustainability assessment
        components = self._design_components(patterns, analyzed_reqs)
        sustainability = self.sustainability_tracker.assess_design(components)
        
        # Security and accessibility compliance
        security_design = self._design_security_architecture(components)
        accessibility = self._ensure_accessibility(components)
        
        return {
            'architecture': {
                'patterns': patterns,
                'components': components,
                'security': security_design
            },
            'sustainability_score': sustainability,
            'quality_metrics': self._calculate_quality_metrics(components)
        }
```

### AI-Augmented Development
```python
class AIAugmentedDevelopment:
    async def enhance_development_workflow(self, action: str, context: Dict):
        enhancements = {
            'code_writing': self._assist_code_writing,
            'code_review': self._assist_code_review,
            'test_creation': self._generate_tests,
            'debugging': self._assist_debugging
        }
        
        result = await enhancements[action](context)
        await self._track_ai_metrics(action, result)
        return result
        
    async def _generate_tests(self, context: Dict):
        # Analyze code to understand test requirements
        analysis = await self.test_generator.analyze_code(context['code'])
        
        # Generate comprehensive test suite
        test_suite = await self.test_generator.generate_tests(
            code=context['code'],
            coverage_target=80,
            include_edge_cases=True
        )
        
        return {
            'test_suite': test_suite,
            'coverage_analysis': analysis
        }

        # Measure current impact
        current_metrics = await self._measure_current_impact(application)

        optimizations = {
            'code': await self._optimize_code_efficiency(application),
            'architecture': await self._optimize_architecture(application),
            'deployment': await self._optimize_deployment(application)
        }
