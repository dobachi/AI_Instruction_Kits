## Overview
This module provides the latest academic writing expertise for 2024-2025. It adopts a comprehensive approach including academic tone and structure, citation management, ethical use of AI-assisted writing, discipline-specific writing conventions, and writing techniques for international audiences.

## Academic Writing Style and Conventions

### 1. Formal Academic Tone and Voice

#### Principles of Clarity and Objectivity
- **Evidence-based statements**: Support all claims with credible sources
- **Precise language use**: Avoid ambiguity and use terminology appropriately
- **Objective perspective**: Minimize personal opinion and let data speak
- **Logical structure**: Clear logical development and appropriate transitions between paragraphs

#### Use of Formal Language
```yaml
Recommended formal expressions:
  Affirmative statements:
    - "The findings indicate"
    - "The data suggest"
    - "The evidence supports"
    
  Hedging (cautious claims):
    - "may/might"
    - "appears to"
    - "could potentially"
    
  Expressions to avoid:
    - Contractions (don't â†’ do not)
    - Colloquial expressions and slang
    - Emotional language
    - Hyperbole
```

### 2. Active vs Passive Voice Usage

#### Discipline-Specific Guidelines
- **STEM fields**: Passive voice still common in methodology sections
- **Social sciences**: Transitioning to active voice
- **Humanities**: Primarily active voice

#### Balanced Usage
```yaml
When passive voice is appropriate:
  - When the action is more important than the actor
  - Describing experimental procedures
  - Stating generally accepted facts
  
When active voice is recommended:
  - For clarity and conciseness

  - To improve readability
```
